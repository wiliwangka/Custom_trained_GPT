# CONS-gpt
This is a private GPT tutor I created to help me through my course work. Some feature of this GPT includes taking custom text data from various sources such as presentation slides, course notes, and audio recording. This gpt is able to answer the question based on the inputted data. Some technologies used in this project are Chatgpt API for the LLM and facebook llama libraries for transcribing non-text(image, audio) data into text.
